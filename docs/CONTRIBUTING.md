# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! This is primarily a personal learning project, but I welcome:

- 🐛 **Bug Reports** - Open a GitHub Issue with reproduction steps
- 💡 **Feature Suggestions** - Especially for collectibles/photography workflows
- 📖 **Documentation Improvements** - Typos, clarity, examples
- 🧪 **Test Coverage** - More edge cases always appreciated

**Before submitting PRs:**
- Run `npm run test:run` (all tests must pass)
- Follow existing code style (Prettier config included)
- Add tests for new features

**Not Accepting (Yet):**
- Major refactors without discussion
- UI frameworks other than React/Tailwind
- Features that require new paid services
