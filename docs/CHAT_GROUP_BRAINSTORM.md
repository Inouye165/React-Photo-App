# Group Chat Brainstorming

## Goals
- Privacy-first group chats (family, collectors, small groups).
- Simple creation, invites, and shared media.
- Safe moderation without “social network” exposure.

## Brainstorming Notes
- Group types: family, collector club, small team, event.
- Roles: owner, admin, member.
- Invites: link/QR, direct invites, optional join requests.
- Media: shared album feed, pins, highlights.
- Notifications: @mentions, digest for high activity.
- Safety: reporting, mute, leave group, block users.

## Open Questions
- Should groups be tied to albums or separate?
- Do we allow mixed content (photos + chat) or photo-centric only?
- Are group chats discoverable or strictly invite-only?
- How to handle users leaving (message history visibility)?

## Decisions (to fill in)
- Discoverability: 
- Content model: 
- Group/album relationship: 
- Leave policy: 

## Staged Rollout Ideas
1) Stage 1 — Basic group chat
   - Create group, invite members, send messages.
   - Owner + member roles only.
   - Simple list + notifications.

2) Stage 2 — Media + UX
   - Group avatar, description.
   - Shared photo feed + pinning.
   - Search within group.

3) Stage 3 — Admin + safety
   - Admin roles, remove/ban, lock group.
   - Reporting, moderation, audit log.

4) Stage 4 — Growth controls
   - Invite links/QR, join requests.
   - Optional discovery (if ever desired).
