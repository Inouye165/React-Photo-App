PR: Harden image auth and switch to httpOnly cookie sessions

Branch: fix/secure-cookie-auth
PR: #24 (please paste the contents below into the PR description before merging)

Summary
-------
This change removes the insecure practice of placing short-lived JWTs into image URLs (e.g. `?token=...`). Instead:

- The image-serving route `/display/:state/:filename` is protected by the standard cookie/httpOnly-based authentication middleware.
- Any request including a `token` query parameter is now rejected (HTTP 403) to prevent accidental token leakage via logs, browser history, or Referer headers.
- Frontend guidance updated: browser clients should use the httpOnly `authToken` cookie (set on login) and request images from the API origin so the cookie is sent (use `credentials: 'include'`).
- Tests updated (unit + integration) to assert query-param token rejection and to use login+cookie flows; integration mocks updated accordingly.
- README updated to document the new session policy and to mark the old TODO as completed.

Why
---
Embedding JWTs in URLs exposes tokens to logs, browser history, and third-party referers. Using httpOnly cookies prevents client-side access to tokens and reduces accidental leakage.

What changed (code highlights)
------------------------------
- server/middleware/imageAuth.js: now rejects presence of `req.query.token` (including empty values) and returns 403 with a clear message; still accepts cookie Bearer or Authorization header for token verification.
- server/routes/photos.js: `/display/:state/:filename` uses the image-specific authenticate middleware.
- server/tests/*: unit and integration tests refactored to use login + cookie flows; tests asserting token-in-query behavior now assert 403 rejection.
- src/api.js: changed fallback API base from a developer IP to `http://localhost:3001` and re-affirmed usage of `credentials: 'include'`.
- README.md: removed guidance to put tokens in image URLs and added instructions for cookie/session usage.

Files changed (summary)
----------------------
- server/middleware/imageAuth.js
- server/routes/photos.js
- server/tests/imageAuth.test.js
- server/tests/integration.test.js
- server/tests/* (other test adjustments)
- src/api.js
- README.md

Test results (local run)
------------------------
- Backend (Jest) - server: 15 test suites passed, 139 tests passed
  Summary: Test Suites: 15 passed, 15 total; Tests: 139 passed, 139 total; Time: ~3.8s

- Frontend (Vitest) - root: 8 test files passed, 70 tests passed
  Summary: Test Files: 8 passed (8); Tests: 70 passed (70)

Notes for reviewer
------------------
- The server tests include explicit checks that requests with `?token=` are rejected. That is expected and intentional: the code now rejects query tokens by design.
- Frontend code was updated to use cookie-based sessions. When testing in the browser, ensure you use `VITE_API_URL` (or proxy) so the browser will set/send the httpOnly `authToken` cookie.
- I left a short note in README and a PR draft file with this summary so you can copy/paste it into PR #24.

Suggested PR body additions
---------------------------
- Add the green CI/test badges and the exact test run output if you paste the above test summaries.
- In the PR description mention any deployment notes (cookie domain changes, if applicable) â€” by default this works with same-origin or with proper CORS/credentials settings.

Next steps (recommended)
------------------------
- Merge after review. Consider running the project's CI to confirm the same results on the CI environment.
- Optionally scan the repo for any third-party code that may still be generating token-in-URL links and remove those occurrences.
- Update any external documentation or deployment notes that referenced token-in-URL examples.
