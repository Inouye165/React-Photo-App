-> **A photo workspace I built to learn how real production apps are architected — security, scaling, and all the unglamorous stuff.**
+Lumina is an AI-powered, privacy-first photo workspace — built to learn and practice industry-leading engineering standards.
+
+Lumina is a long-running engineering project focused on security, scalability, and maintainability. The goal is to evolve into a community-oriented platform (sharing + chat) while keeping user data isolation, consent, and privacy at the center.
 
-This started as a way to practice backend engineering and security habits. It's grown into something I actually use. The backend is solid; the frontend is functional but still rough around the edges. Maybe one day it'll support sharing and collaboration, but for now it's focused on doing the basics right.
+The frontend is still evolving; the backend and security posture are treated as first-class concerns.

+- Be kind and inclusive: This project aims to welcome contributors and users from all backgrounds.
+- Privacy-first by default: User data isolation, least-privilege access, and secure-by-design patterns are core requirements.
+- Transparency: Security trade-offs and changes should be documented. No “security theater.”
+- Respectful community: Harassment, hate, and abusive behavior are not welcome.
+
+## 🔒 Privacy & user isolation (north star)
+
+Lumina is designed around isolated user workspaces: each user’s photos, metadata, and derived AI outputs must remain private and access-controlled. Sharing features (albums, links, chat) should be opt-in, permissioned, and auditable.

-- **Be decent:** Everyone's welcome here.
