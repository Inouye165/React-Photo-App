# Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Inouye165/React-Photo-App.git
   cd React-Photo-App
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies (use `--legacy-peer-deps` if you see errors):
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   cd ..
   ```

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both the root and `server/` directories and fill in all required values.

5. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

6. Start the frontend (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

# Troubleshooting

- **Dependency errors:** If you see errors about conflicting dependencies (e.g., ERESOLVE), always use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.
- **Missing libraries:** If you see errors like "Cannot find module 'zustand'" or '@supabase/supabase-js', run `npm install <package> --legacy-peer-deps` in the correct directory (root for frontend, `server/` for backend).
- **Missing environment variables:** If you see errors about missing environment variables, ensure you have copied `.env.example` to `.env` and filled in all required values in both root and `server/`.
- **Wrong install directory:** Always run frontend installs in the project root and backend installs in the `server/` directory.
- **ImageMagick not found:** Make sure ImageMagick is installed and available in your system PATH for HEIC/HEIF fallback support.

# Dependency Verification

All required libraries are listed in the appropriate `package.json` files:
- Frontend dependencies: `package.json` (project root)
- Backend dependencies: `server/package.json`

If you encounter a missing package error, please open an issue or PR to add it to the correct `package.json`.

# Environment Variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both the root and `server/` directories.
- Fill in all required values before running the app.
- Do not commit `.env` files to source control.

## Key Features (2025 Update)

### üîê Security & Authentication
- **JWT Authentication System:** Secure login with bcrypt password hashing and 24-hour token expiration
- **Protected Image Access:** All images served through authenticated endpoints requiring valid JWT tokens
- **Multi-Source Authentication:** Support for Authorization headers, query parameters, and cookies
- **Security Middleware:** Comprehensive protection with Helmet (CSP, HSTS, XSS), rate limiting, and input validation
- **CORS Configuration:** Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing for secure frontend access

### üì∏ Advanced Photo Management
- **Backend-driven workflow:** All photo management, metadata, and permissions are handled by the backend server. The React app fetches and displays everything from backend APIs.
- **Enhanced HEIC/HEIF Support:** Automatic conversion to JPEG with Smart fallback (Sharp ‚Üí ImageMagick), authenticated serving, and multi-machine file synchronization
- **Folder picker & date filter:** Select a local folder, filter photos by date (using EXIF/file dates), and upload only the filtered files to the backend.
- **Hash-based deduplication:** Every file is hashed (SHA-256) on upload/ingest. Duplicate files (by content) are automatically skipped. The UI shows the last 5 digits of each file's hash.
- **Privileges column:** The app displays actual file system privileges (read/write/execute) for each photo as reported by the backend.
- **Automatic DB migration:** The backend automatically upgrades the database schema (e.g., adds missing columns) on startup, with no data loss.
- **Robust error handling:** All errors and upload messages are shown in a prominent toast at the top of the app.

### ü§ñ AI & Processing
- **AI-powered captions and descriptions:** The backend uses OpenAI Vision to generate captions, descriptions, and keywords for each photo, including HEIC/HEIF files.
- **Interactive Canvas Editor:** Edit photos with an interactive canvas that allows you to position captions directly on images. Drag text to reposition, customize font size and color, and save your layout preferences. Text styling persists across editing sessions.

### üé® User Interface
- **Upload panel:** The photo upload panel now fills the viewport under the toolbar, with a compact file list and flush-edge layout. No large image previews; file list shows filename, date, size, and type.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices with touch-friendly interfaces

### üß™ Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive Testing Suite:** Production-ready testing with Vitest and Jest. 86 tests total:
  - **Frontend**: 66 tests with Vitest + React Testing Library covering user interactions, state management, error handling, accessibility, and authentication utilities  
  - **Backend**: 20+ tests with Jest + Supertest covering API endpoints, database operations, file upload handling, authentication flows, security middleware, and HEIC conversion
  - **Integration**: Complete end-to-end authentication and image access workflows
  - **Security Testing**: Validation of JWT flows, CORS configuration, and security headers
  - **Regression Prevention**: Tests specifically designed to prevent previously encountered issues
  - **Test Isolation**: Proper DOM cleanup between tests and comprehensive mocking strategies

## Usage (2025)

1. Start the backend server (`cd server && npm start`).
2. Start the frontend (`npm run dev`).
3. In the app, click "Select Folder for Upload" to pick a local folder.
4. Filter/select photos by date, then upload to the backend.
5. The backend view shows all photos, metadata, privileges, and hash info. No duplicates are stored.
6. If a file fails AI processing (shows 'AI processing failed'), POST to `/debug/reset-ai-retry` and click "Recheck Inprogress AI" to retry.
7. The upload panel is now flush with the viewport edges, matching other views. The file list is compact and readable.

## File Hashing & Deduplication

- Every photo is hashed (SHA-256) on upload or server start.
- If a file with the same hash already exists, it is skipped (not re-uploaded or re-indexed).
- The UI shows a ‚úî and the last 5 digits of the hash for each photo.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Edge recommended for full features)
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) installed and available in your system PATH (for HEIC/HEIF support)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Inouye165/React-Photo-App.git
   cd React-Photo-App
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

### Development

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
   Server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

2. Start the frontend development server (in new terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Authentication Setup

The application requires user authentication for all image operations. On first run:

1. **Register a new account**: Navigate to the login page and create an account with username, email, and password
2. **Login**: Use your credentials to obtain a JWT token (valid for 24 hours)
3. **Automatic token management**: The app automatically includes your token in all image requests
4. **Multi-device support**: Login on multiple machines with the same account for seamless multi-machine workflows

**Security Features:**
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration  
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Account lockout protection
- Secure image serving with authentication validation

### Environment Configuration

The frontend uses environment variables for configuration:

- `VITE_API_URL`: Base URL for the backend API (default: `http://localhost:3001`)

To override for production or different environments, create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-production-api.com
```

This allows easy deployment to different environments without code changes.

## Environment Variables (template)

Create a `.env` file at the project root and fill in the values you need. Example:

```text
# Frontend (Vite)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Backend / Server (see server/README.md for full template)
# PORT=3001
# JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_string
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key
```

Do not commit `.env` to source control. Add it to `.gitignore`.

### Build

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
# Frontend tests (Vitest) - 66 tests
npm test

# Run all frontend tests once
npm run test:run

# Run frontend tests with UI dashboard
npm run test:ui

# Run frontend tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Backend tests (Jest) - 20+ tests

- **Database Testing**: SQLite operations, schema constraints, CRUD operations, user management
- **Integration Testing**: Complete authenticated request/response cycles
- **Error Scenarios**: Permission errors, disk issues, invalid files, authentication failures
- **Multi-machine Testing**: File sync scenarios, graceful degradation

**Total: 86 tests with robust coverage of authentication, security, and HEIC functionality**

## Usage

1. Open the application in a modern web browser
2. Click "Select Folder for Upload" - the folder picker will open in your Pictures folder (on supported browsers)
3. The application will scan and display all supported image files in chronological order
4. Use the "Start Date" and "End Date" inputs to filter photos by date taken
5. The list updates instantly as you change dates, showing the filtered count
6. Click "Upload" to send filtered photos to the backend
7. The backend view shows all photos, metadata, privileges, and hash info
8. Click on a photo to edit it - the interactive canvas editor allows you to position captions on the image:
   - Drag the text to reposition it anywhere on the image
   - Use the controls to adjust font size and color
   - Edit the caption text directly in the editor
   - Click "Save Captioned Image" to persist your text positioning and styling
9. If a file fails AI processing (shows 'AI processing failed'), POST to `/debug/reset-ai-retry` and click "Recheck Inprogress AI" to retry

## Thumbnails

- **Automatic thumbnail generation**: The backend generates thumbnails for every image in the `working` folder and serves them from `/thumbnails/<hash>.jpg` so the frontend can display fast previews without re-reading original files.
- **HEIC/HEIF support and fallback**: Thumbnails are generated with `sharp` when possible. If `sharp`/libvips lacks HEIF/HEIC support, the server will attempt a fallback conversion using ImageMagick (the `magick` command) to create thumbnails. Install ImageMagick with HEIF delegates on your system to enable the fallback.

## HEIC/HEIF AI Processing Support
- HEIC/HEIF files are now supported for AI processing. If the backend cannot convert HEIC using sharp, it will automatically use ImageMagick as a fallback.
- If a file fails AI processing (shows 'AI processing failed'), you can reset its retry count by POSTing to `/debug/reset-ai-retry` and then clicking 'Recheck Inprogress AI' in the frontend to retry processing.
- For new HEIC files, no manual intervention is needed.

## Troubleshooting
- **HEIC/HEIF 'bad seek' errors**: These are expected when Sharp can't decode certain HEIC variants. The system automatically falls back to ImageMagick - no action needed.
- **ImageMagick not found**: Make sure ImageMagick is installed and available in your system PATH for HEIC/HEIF fallback support.
- **AI processing failures**: Check the backend logs. You can reset retry counts via `/debug/reset-ai-retry` and click 'Recheck Inprogress AI'.
- **Test failures**: Run `npm test` to see detailed error messages. Ensure all dependencies are installed and environment is properly configured.

## Known Limitations

- **Browser Security**: Only works with locally selected files due to browser security restrictions
- **Performance**: Large folders may take time to process initially  
- **EXIF Dependency**: EXIF data reading depends on photo metadata being present
- **Date Fallback**: Falls back to file modification date if EXIF date is unavailable
- **API Requirements**: File System Access API requires user gesture and HTTPS in production
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers required for full feature set (Chrome, Edge recommended)

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- **integration.test.js**: End-to-end authentication flows, multi-machine scenarios, performance testing

### Test Architecture  
- **Vitest**: Modern testing framework with native Vite integration for frontend
- **Jest**: Traditional testing framework with Supertest for backend HTTP testing
- **React Testing Library**: User-centric component testing approach
- **Mock Strategy**: Isolated tests with proper API, filesystem, and database mocking
- **Test Isolation**: DOM cleanup between tests, no cross-test contamination
- **CI Ready**: All 63 tests pass consistently for automated deployment

## Open TODOs
- **Resize and compress all images before sending to OpenAI Vision API to reduce costs. (Convert to JPEG, max 1024x1024, quality 70‚Äì80.)**
- If a file fails AI processing (shows 'AI processing failed'), use the /debug/reset-ai-retry endpoint to reset its retry count, then click 'Recheck Inprogress AI' to retry processing.
- Add WebSocket/SSE for live photo state and thumbnail updates ‚Äî push notifications when files change or thumbnails are created.
- Make thumbnail generation asynchronous and cache-optimized ‚Äî generate thumbnails in background workers and avoid blocking startup.
- Add client-side content-hash check to avoid uploading duplicates ‚Äî compute file hash in browser and skip uploads if server already has the hash.
- Add filename search and full-size preview modal in frontend ‚Äî quick search, sort, and modal for viewing images at full resolution.
- ~~Add automated tests and CI pipeline for build and linting~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive testing implemented with 63 tests (54 frontend + 9 backend)
- Add GitHub Actions CI pipeline for automated testing and deployment

### Recommended security & CI TODOs (priority)

- **HUSKY pre-commit secret-scan (HIGH PRIORITY ‚Äî recommended)**: add Husky and a pre-commit hook that scans staged files for potential secrets (API keys, private keys, tokens) and blocks commits when matches are found. Provide a command to opt-in/install hooks for contributors and document it in the README (example: `npm run prepare` to install Husky hooks). This helps prevent accidental credential commits.

- Update GitHub Actions workflows to use repository secrets and remove any embedded test/placeholder keys from workflow YAMLs. Document required secret names (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`) in `PRODUCTION_SETUP.md` or `server/README.md`.

- Add a CI job to run a secret-scan on PRs (e.g., detect accidentally committed secrets in the diff) and fail the build if sensitive data is found.

- Document a short secret-rotation / incident response procedure in the README (who to notify, how to rotate keys, and how to revoke exposed tokens) and link to it from `PRODUCTION_SETUP.md`.

- Add a small contributor onboarding note describing how to copy `.env.example` to `.env`, where to store secrets (repo secrets for CI), and how to enable Husky locally.

> Note: The Husky pre-commit hook is the recommended first step ‚Äî it stops secret leaks at the source (dev machines) and is quick to add.

## Progress saved (work-in-progress)

- Modularized gallery and upload UI into `src/PhotoGallery.jsx` and `src/PhotoUploadForm.jsx`.
- Fixed upload callsites to use the backend upload endpoint and added upload/fetch logging.
- Upload panel now fills the viewport under the toolbar, with a compact file list and flush-edge layout. No large image previews; file list shows filename, date, size, and type.
- Server skips non-image files (e.g., desktop.ini) and logs them, instead of exiting. HEIC/HEIF support confirmed with ImageMagick fallback.
- **NEW: Interactive canvas editor implemented** - `ImageCanvasEditor.jsx` provides drag-and-drop text positioning on images with font size/color controls. Text styling persists across editing sessions.
- **NEW: Comprehensive testing suite implemented** - 66 tests (54 frontend + 9 backend + 1 E2E) covering all React components and API endpoints with Vitest, Jest, React Testing Library, and Supertest. Includes user interaction, state management, error handling, database operations, and accessibility testing.
- **NEW: Toolbar messaging system** - Upload success messages now appear in the toolbar instead of popup toasts, providing persistent feedback until dismissed or page reload.
- **NEW: Optimized HEIC conversion logging** - Reduced console noise by only logging errors when both Sharp and ImageMagick fail. Silent fallback for expected codec limitations.
- **FIXED: Photo editing workflow** - Edit button properly wired with `handleEditPhoto` prop, delete confirmation dialogs now work correctly.
- Remaining open items: CSS grid for thumbnails, live updates, search, GitHub Actions CI, and backend captioned image file export.

<!-- `App_clean.jsx` has been removed from the repository. Use `src/App.jsx` as the mounted entry. -->
