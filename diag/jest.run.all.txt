This repo uses Vitest (see package.json scripts: `npm run test`, `npm run test:run`).

If you see a prompt like "Need to install jest@… Ok to proceed?", it likely came from running a
standalone `jest` command or an old local setup. Prefer running:

- `npm run test` (watch)
- `npm run test:run` (CI/run mode)
